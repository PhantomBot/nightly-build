# nightly-build
This repository contains a nightly build of PhantomBot from the latest master branch.

# Notice
Use this nightly build at your own risk!  The master branch is not always fully tested.  There may be new features added which may cause problems with your PhantomBot environment.  It is not wise to just copy off scripts without the new core and possibly the library directories.  

# Support
No support will be provided for the nightly build.  Please report bugs, but, we will not answer questions regarding how to setup, install, or configure new features.  Typically instructions for new features will be included on the Nightly Build page for items that we would like folks to test when they are ready to be tested.
