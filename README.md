# nightly-build
This repository contains a nightly build of PhantomBot from the latest master branch.

# Notice
Use this nightly build at your own risk!  The master branch is not always fully tested.  There may be new features added which may cause problems with your PhantomBot environment.  It is not wise to just copy off scripts without the new core and possibly the library directories.  

# Support
No support will be provided for the nightly build.
